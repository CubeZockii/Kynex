# Moderation-Bot

A Moderation Bot that can be used for your Server. Has an option to be used as a logging Bot (logging_cog.py). If not using to log ignore the Error when starting the Bot ”Mistake at Laden von LoggingCog: Extension 'logging_cog' could not be loaded or found.” The Bot will still work normal but won’t log anything that is able to be logged.

# Commands:

- Ban/Unban
- Kick
- Purge
- Warn/Unwarn
- Warnings
- revive
- role
- help
- Mute/Unmute
- Lock/Unlock
- ping

The Warn system has an automatic punishment system that takes action when a member reaches a certain Number of Warnings. U can change this later on for your own server.

**A Rework of the Warn System may come soon**
